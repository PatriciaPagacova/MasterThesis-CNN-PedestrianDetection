# Pedestrian detection

## Description
This work deals with the detection of pedestrians in the image, based on machine learning
using deep neural networks. For this purpose, the work uses the Object Detection
API provided by TensorFlow framework. This framework is developed by Google and
provides support for a wide range of artificial intelligence tasks. The work describes the
sequence of steps needed to start the process of training the detection model in the TensorFlow
environment. Using this procedure, it performs several trainings using different
combinations of input parameters. Runs of these trainings are analyzed by TensorBoard
tool. Google provides several pre-trained models that allow rapid acceleration of
training. We will use three of them in our work. We will train two non-detecting pedestrians
and the third one, supporting pedestrian detection, we will use unchanged. The
speed and accuracy of pedestrian detection of all three models will be experimentally
evaluated on a prepared set of images inputs, capturing a wide range of conditions in
which pedestrians may occur.
